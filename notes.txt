Project Goals:

1. Create server folder ✅
2. Create tracks.py which will authenticate and pull from the spotify api 
	- Get it to print to console 
	- Find out more about how to filter it. 
3. Create ingest.py which puts the information from the tracks.py into the postgreSQL db. 







Project Steps: 
	1. Create workable object in tracks.py✅
		1. get api key/set up oauth2 flow✅
		2. create a class for tracks✅
			- test it our like covid19 app (use api tracks docs to 
			structure data model. ✅
		3. Create class for API response object and item✅
			- this should set the limit of tracks to pull ( 300?)
		4. Create class for bad request, exceptions,unauthorized errors (3)✅
	2. Create workable object in models.py✅
		1. Create tables in python for the db 
			- tracks table 
	3. Create constants.py and set genre definition✅
	4. Test ✅
	5. get podcast episodes into postgreSQL or set up csv to deposit into postgresql via pgAdmin✅
	*clean the csv*
	6. Make dashboard folder
		- figure out what I want to study? 

	** Ideas **
	1. Does Track title have a relationship with how many plays a song will get?
	2. Can we use this information to predict the next billboard top 100? 
	3. What are the most popular genres

	** Figure out how to implement this in Airflow   **
